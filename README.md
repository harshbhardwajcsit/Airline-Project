The Idea is to build a system to hadle bookings and managing multiple available flights between available airports

1. Every Airline has details about the meals served and seats
2. AirlineLiveServices.js is to handle the status of additional service like meals, its count left, seat availability etc. 
3. Schedule.js will contains to details about the flight schedules after the bookings, like a dashborad/screen available at airports to check live status.
4. AvailabilityTimeline.js will handle the availble flights, its seats, meals status between two airport and within selected time periods, like from = 9AM  to = 9PM
5. Bookings.js will handle the details about each booking created.
6. GeospaticalWeather.js will have the details about the weather conditions based on lattitude and longitude, and one the basis of the weatherDetermination ratio, the availability of
 airports will be decided.
